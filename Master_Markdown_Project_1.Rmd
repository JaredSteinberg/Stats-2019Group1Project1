We are using the `Marraige` dataset provided in R package `mosaicData`. It provides marriage records from the Mobile County, AL probate court between 11/9/96 and 2/6/99.  Variables recorded include:

* **age - age of person**
* **college - number of years in college**
* **person - a factor with levels Bride and Groom**
* **prevconc - way the last marriage ended**
* **race - race of person, being American Indian, Black, Hispanic, and White**


```{r message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
data(Marriage, package = "mosaicData")

```


```{r}
marriage_plot <- ggplot(Marriage, aes(x = prevconc, y = age)) + geom_boxplot(aes(color = person), fill = "aliceblue") + theme_economist()
marriage_plot <- marriage_plot + ggtitle("Comparison of How Prvious Marriage Ended Based on Age")
marriage_plot
```
